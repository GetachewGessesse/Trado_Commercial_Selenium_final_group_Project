## *A Introduction to this Project*

  >>TRADO developed marketplace platform is unique in its entirety and the scope of the solution it provides to users -retailers / buyers and suppliers / sellers. Unlike existing trading platforms in the B2B market that produce a relationship between suppliers andbuyers, the platform is developed to produce an anonymous market. 
  >A market where the details of sellers and buyers are known to the system only and are not visible. In order to enable trade and transfer of goods in an anonymous environment, the system provides, in addition to the market environment component, a component that handles the transportation of the goods, as well as a component for providing advanced credit solutions.The system provides management tools, decision making, tracking and alerts when it relies on user behavior data, contact with users' purchasing and inventory systems, contact with moving systems, contact external systems for information to assess the capabilities of the buyer seeking financial assistance and more. The development isinnovative and challenging.
